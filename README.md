I wrote this project using the java language with the cucumber-bdd framework in selenium.That code challenge is an end-to-end test that covers both objectives.
To begin, the API was used to create the given steps, then the Trello board was tested with selenium test scripts for Objective 01.
To do the first objective dynamic with Selenium, I added a new step as create a list in that board.

And also I added login part to test with negative paths. In addition to the objective 02 hp test scenario, I added adding comment negative scenario.

Thank you for your time.
