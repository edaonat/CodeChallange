I wrote this project using the java language with the cucumber-bdd framework in selenium. That code challenge is an end-to-end test that covers both objectives. Before starting, I did manual test in Postman for CRUD operations. After that, the API was used to create the given steps, then the Trello board was tested with selenium test scripts for Objective 01. To do the Objective 01 dynamic with Selenium, I added a new step as creating a list on that board.

And also I added login part to test with negative paths. In addition to the Objective 02 hp test scenario, I added a new test scenario as add a comment for negative test scenario. 

Thank you for your time and concern.
